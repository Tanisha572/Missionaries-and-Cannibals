# Missionaries and Cannibals Problem solved using C++

## <u> Traditional Problem Statement:</u>

In the missionaries and cannibals problem, three missionaries and three cannibals must cross a river using a boat which can carry at most two people, under the constraint that, for both banks, if there are missionaries present on the bank, they cannot be outnumbered by cannibals (if they were, the cannibals would eat the missionaries). The boat cannot cross the river by itself with no people on board.



## <u>Problem tackled:</u>

The original problem is generalised by allowing the player to choose the number of missionaries and cannibals and the boat capacity at the beginning of the game. Other original constraints are kept in place.

Let there be **n** missionaries and cannibals on the left bank and a boat capacity of **b**. 

## <u>Constraints:</u>

-  n is a natural number

- b > 1

- for each bank, #missionaries != 0 => (#missionaries > #cannibals)
